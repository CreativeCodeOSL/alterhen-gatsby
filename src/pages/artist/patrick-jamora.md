name: Patrick Jamora
bio: Patrick Jamora is a graphic designer, photographer and multimedia artist
  from the Philippines, working with images and typography to investigate the
  curiosities and imperfections of the documentary process.
country: Philippines
title: Good-Natured Savages
statement: "In Good-Natured Savages, Patrick re-documents records from the
  World's Fair at St. Louis in 1904, where more than 1,100 native Filipinos were
  exhibited. Using archival images and text copied directly from captions, his
  work highlights how the Filipinos were portrayed as uncivilized and
  underdeveloped savages and how it contributed to perpetuating a condescending
  view of their culture. The title comes from the caption in one of the images:
  \"Every day in the week is receiving day with these good-natured savages.\""
