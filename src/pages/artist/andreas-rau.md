name: Andreas Rau
bio: Andreas Rau is a generative artist and interaction designer exploring the
  interplay between humans and their digital and physical environments in
  kinetic sculptures, plotter drawings, and generative visuals.
country: Norway
title: City Scapes
statement: >-
  The city, to me, is more than mere physical space. It is, in many ways, an
  ever-changing system that, just as a generative algorithm, takes on countless
  different shapes while remaining the same at its core.


  City Scapes is a series that, through a generative algorithm, explores human perception in the context of the cities we live in. The series is the result of ongoing experimentation inspired by abstract expressionism and the textures of a tapestry.
