bio: >-
    Born in 1992, Bernardo holds a degree in Graphic Design from PUC-Rio, an urban artist and tattoo artist. He began his research in plastic arts in 2018. A descendant of Orientals and a resident of Rio de Janeiro, his job consists of searching intersections between these worlds. Intersections that time is subtle, time is explicit. There are few moments when we perceive them as coexisting in the same space and time. Possible places of collision, whether symbols, feelings, or habits - what is established and what is to come. The result is works that start from these perceptions of ancestry that blend with layers of realities that cross the artist.

    "Differences become affective aesthetic bodies (work), as possible ways of distributing love and understanding." - Edmilson Nunes*
statement: >-
    The theme appropriates the speech in the form of hot dishes, and the hardened cement is what we harvest, what is served to us and what's left for us, but not what we see. False promises and tricked people, soothed by the sarcastic phrase “Made with Love”.
    This work was developed during the Formation and Deformation Course, at EAV-Parque Lage. Where we worked during the school term, above questions about transport, food and their crossings.
