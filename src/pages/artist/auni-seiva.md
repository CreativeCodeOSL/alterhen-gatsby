    Coming from the culture of graffiti means “writing your name everywhere”, which is very nice, but, as this did not completely satisfy me, I tried to go deeper into the path of contemporary art, (definitely the meetings of the art discussion group “3a. via”, through my mentor @ tinho23sp were essential for the development of my work), so I started collecting objects on the street, and, I agglutinate them to cement, in molds made of cardboard. The “Blocos de Energia” series appeared during the artistic residency at Funarte and won me a prize in 2018, in addition to the sculptures, I also paint murals with drawings of the enlarged objects, a way to make citizens see the garbage problems that used to go unnoticed, like, "I'm not responsible for all that trash!", trying to criticize the consumer society, I should also cite the book "Tao of physics" CAPRA, Frijot (read in 2016), as the driving force behind my research, because the energy blocks represent the formation of matter in the quantum world, which occurs through certain blocks, which they generate pattern packages before it materialize, that is, they bring from the invisible to the visible, show what is hidden, I try to connect internal and external worlds, in truth, I believe we are not separated creatures, our environment is a reflection of what we really are
