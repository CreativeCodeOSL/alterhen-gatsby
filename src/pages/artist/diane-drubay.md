bio: Diane Drubay is a visual artist working with photography and digital media
  to create visions of alternative realities. She nudges for more Nature
  awareness and positive change for better futures.
country: France
title: Nuclei
statement: >-
  In her most recent body of work, Diane Drubay imagines secluded landscapes in
  a far future where the Sun can no longer be seen. In this time, Humankind
  constructed artificial planets with solar panels to catch solar energy and
  feed Planet Earth. The only source of natural energy, the artificial planets
  float around in the atmosphere, obstructing our view of the sky and becoming a
  part of our daily lives.

  Deprived of people and calling for the contemplation of a vast and empty landscape, the immersion in this universe is both fascinating and shattering.

  Drawn by the aesthetics of social science fiction literature and current scientific discoveries, the speculative visions depicted by Diane Drubay advocate for optimistic images interpreting shocking stories of possible futures.
