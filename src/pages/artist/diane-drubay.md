bio: >-
    Diane Drubay's fascination with natural light and colours started in 2012 while waiting for the golden hour in the garden of Claude Monet at Giverny. There, she captured the awakening of Nature and its changes over the months (she produced or supervised the series of videos 'Monet's Secret Garden').

    She believes Nature gives us frames and patterns to reflect and expand our minds, to see our surroundings in clarity with new perspectives and understandings. By showing the real and the unity of being in the trail of the Ideal, Nature shows Humanity how to transcend themselves. It is time for us to see Nature like it is and care for it and its future.

    Between 2013 and 2018, she has been working on one project tracing the different stages to reach the ultimate transcendence through Nature by compiling hundreds of impressions of the rising and setting sun. This led to a final 23-minute video untitled "Odyssey" and a great number of single videos and photographs. Since 2019, she is exploring natural glitches Nature and how they impact our vision of landscapes and our imagination of the future. With her sci-fi infused landscapes, she works towards more Nature-awareness by telling positive stories of the Future.
