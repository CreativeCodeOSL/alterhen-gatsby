statement: >-
  TBC / In her most recent body of work, Diane Drubay imagines secluded
  landscapes in a far future where the Sun can no longer be seen. In this time,
  Humankind constructed artificial planets with solar panels to catch solar
  energy and feed Planet Earth. The only source of natural energy, the
  artificial planets float around in the atmosphere, obstructing our view of the
  sky and becoming a part of our daily lives.

  Deprived of people and calling for the contemplation of a vast and empty landscape, the immersion in this universe is both fascinating and shattering.

  Drawn by the aesthetics of social science fiction literature and current scientific discoveries, the speculative visions depicted by Diane Drubay advocate for optimistic images interpreting shocking stories of possible futures.
