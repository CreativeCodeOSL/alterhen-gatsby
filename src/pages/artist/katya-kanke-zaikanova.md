bio: >-
    I started my career as a photographer. For 10 years I studied photography and filmmaking, and later began to combine different media in my art. I work with photography, performance art, create videos and drawings. My experience of motherhood played an important role in my artistic practice.
    I live in Moscow.

    A work of art at all costs.

    A work of art is sustainable, non-violent, non-oppressive.

    A work of art as trust.

    A work of art as an element.

    A work of art as total control.

    A work of art as unconditional love.

    A work of art as a study of beauty.

    A work of art as a secret history of mankind.

    A work of art as a question.

    A work of art as a catharsis.

    A work of art as a void.

    A work of art as negation.

    A work of art as cognition.

    A work of art as a desire to manifest, capture the movement of the wind, reveal it to the eye and make it invisible again.
