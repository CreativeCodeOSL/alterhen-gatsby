name: Kelly Richardson
bio: Taking cues from art history, cinema, and science, Kelly Richardson
  constructs videos and stills that offer imaginative glimpses of the future
  which prompt a careful consideration of the present.
country: Canada
title: HALO
statement: >-
  HALO I, II and III are sequels to Camp (1998), a video which presents a clich√©
  of outdoor life. Twenty three years later, the promise of what summer brings
  has changed. 


  HALO references the significant feedback loop we are in after decades of warnings. BC is set to have the 3rd worst fire season on record, all of which occurred within the last 5 years. Simultaneously, the UN declared that it is code red for humanity as a result of climate change.
