statement: >-
    I started using Neural Network based Artificial Intelligence technology around 2015.
    I enjoy using optical flow analysis tools to capture motion from moving footage.
    I enjoy manipulating still digital images and motion sequences in a transformative/generative way.
    I’m building and using my own tools using open-sourced and custom code.
    identity is the essence of my work now.
