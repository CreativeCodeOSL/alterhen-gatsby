title: Ménilmontant
statement: an ongoing experimentation with footage from Dmitri Kirsanoff's
  Ménilmontant (1926) starring his wife Nadia Sibirskaïa. I'm using 'artificial
  intelligence' technology to transform early cinema footage. Motion and shapes
  are extracted from the original pictures and feed different 'neural networks'
  to generate abstract visualizations. I like to imagine this new vision embeds
  the imperfections and nostalgia while bringing a different emotional state to
  the viewer. (style transfer - layered style warping. open source + custom
