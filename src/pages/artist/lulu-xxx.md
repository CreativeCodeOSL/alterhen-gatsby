bio: Luluxxx is a photographer, 3D artist and developer based in Paris, working
  to create transformative, generative representations on the theme of identity,
  using neural networks and her own, self-built tools.
country: France
title: Ménilmontant
statement: An ongoing experimentation with footage from Dmitri Kirsanoff's
  Ménilmontant (1926) starring his wife Nadia Sibirskaïa. I'm using 'artificial
  intelligence technology to transform early cinema footage. Motion and shapes
  are extracted from the original pictures and feed different 'neural networks
  to generate abstract visualizations. I like to imagine this new vision embeds
  imperfections and nostalgia while bringing a different emotional state to the
  viewer.
