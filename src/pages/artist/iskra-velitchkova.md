bio: >-
    "(b. 1988)
    Iskra Velitchkova is a Bulgarian self-taught artist currently based in Madrid.

    Her work explores the present and potential interactions between humans and machines and how instead of making technology more human, this relationship can push us to understand our limits better.

    She believes that roots and tradition can nurture her work with greater truth. Bringing together her Balkan origins with the influence that Mediterranean culture has had on her over her own history, she uses this context for building upon her work. After a proven record on tech and artificial intelligence industry as visual thinker, Iskra decided to apply her knowledge and experience at the service of her own research.

    Her work is based on mixed techniques: she explores new media combining digital formats and physical nature. She uses generative technology, artificial neural networks, plastic arts, she plots on canvas and plays with clay."
