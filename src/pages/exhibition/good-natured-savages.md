description: "In Good-Natured Savages, Patrick re-documents records from the
  World's Fair at St. Louis in 1904, where more than 1,100 native Filipinos were
  exhibited. Using archival images and text copied directly from captions, his
  work highlights how the Filipinos were portrayed as uncivilized and
  underdeveloped savages and how it contributed to perpetuating a condescending
  view of their culture. The title comes from the caption in one of the images:
  \"Every day in the week is receiving day with these good-natured savages.\""

      Actual caption on image:

      "To see the smallest people in the world and to observe the lowest order of human intellect World's Fair visitors in great numbers go to the Negrito Village of the Philippine Reservation. Negritos, little negroes, are the original inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. 

      They are barbarians. They have a kind of spirit worship, and all tribes give ceremonial dances. As a rule, they are headhunters. Probably no tribe in the Archipelago can produce such splendid specimens physically.

      The Igorot is one of the most conspicuous races of Northern Luzon. Scientists have declared that with the proper training they are susceptible to a high state of development and unlike the American Indian, will accept, rather than defy, the advance of American Civilization."

      "The most ambitious and advanced of the Igorot community are not above fascinations of the dance, nor can they resist the lifelong habit to appear without clothing. Antaero is far in advance of his people in his efforts to go the white man’s road. He not only speaks English but sings English songs. When the President of the United States asked him how it was that he spoke such good English he said it was because he went to the Filipino school at the World’s Fair every day. His ambition is to teach school when he becomes a man, but when asked if he would wear American clothes, he replied, “I like string breach.” This is the name Igorots apply to the cloud. The school to which Antaero referred is a most interesting educational exhibit."

      "The owners of the camera are informed by placards that they take snapshots in the Filipino village at their own risk. Antaero has acquired fearlessness of the Kodiak with his knowledge of the English language. He poses boldly. Some of his countrymen still cling to the prejudice against being photographed. Antaero’s proudest accomplishment is the singing of “My Country ’Tis of Thee.” He sings slowly and distinctly. When complimented he replies, “Sank Yoh."
