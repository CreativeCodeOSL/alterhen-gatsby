  I started using Neural Network based Artificial Intelligence technology around
  2015.

  I enjoy using optical flow analysis tools to capture motion from moving footage.

  I enjoy manipulating still digital images and motion sequences in a transformative/generative way.

  Iâ€™m building and using my own tools using open-sourced and custom code.

  Identity is the essence of my work now.
