  This collection is part of an ongoing investigation into the artistic
  possibilities of error and uncertainty, as a way of mirroring the mysterious,
  counter-intuitive aspects of the quantum world.

  It is an attempt to accept a ‘failure’ of classical exactitude in aesthetics, as a way of gaining a deeper understanding of the human perception of the world, particularly as that perception modulates in extreme contexts.

  Each work donates 25% to charitable causes.

    title: Milk as Balm
    desc: >+
      Good trouble, necessary trouble...


      Created to mark the social unrest resulting from the police murder of George Floyd and the fight against institutional racism and other forms of discrimination worldwide. This work also forms part of an aesthetic investigation into reality vs unreality as a shifting analogy of quantum systems.


      25% of proceeds will be donated to the Southern Poverty Law Centre in the United States 


      2021.

      Created to mark the protests emerging from the attempted crackdown on
      rights and freedoms in Hong Kong by the Communist Party of China and to
      protest against the violent response to them. 

      The work is also a response to any similar protest situations worldwide and an attempt to highlight the profound importance of civil unrest. 

      The piece also forms part of an ongoing aesthetic investigation into reality vs unreality as a shifting analogy of quantum systems. 


      25% of proceeds will be donated to the charity Hong Kong Watch.

    title: 2 Guns vs the Bear
    desc: >
      The loneliest sport in the world...


      Created to honour the strange bravery and fringe mindsets of fight sport athletes. Here, Michael “2 Guns” Younis and Scott “The Bear” Trelford contest an amateur MMA bout at GTFP Fight Night 3 in Wolverhampton, UK, in 2016. Younis won by TKO (punches) after 1 minute of the first round.

      The piece is part of an ongoing series on the extremes of human existence, parallel to an aesthetic investigation into reality vs unreality as a shifting analogy of quantum systems. 


      25% of proceeds will be donated to the UK-based mental health charity Mind.
