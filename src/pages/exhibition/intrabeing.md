description: What lies within the bounds being? IntraBeing envisions enigmatic
  spaces beyond the capacities of medical imaging tools. The project employs
  MRI-acquired data to reveal alternative time scales inside the human body.
  Joteva worked remotely with scientists at Fraunhofer MEVIS to investigate the
  capacities of medical imaging and simulation procedures in order to locate
  enigmatic spaces that emerge at the limits of their resolution and
  computation. She conducted a series of full-body MRI scans and Diffusion
  Tensor Imaging (DTI) scans, commonly used only to show connectivity in the
  brain, to instead uncover nerve fibres in the chest, pelvic and feet regions
  of her body. She drew inspiration from the fact that hydrogen atoms, which MRI
  relies on, are also in constant flux on a nano-second time-scale and thus
  evade precise measurement. These components are key elements in the artwork
  that exhibits an oscillating inner landscape of hydrogen atoms, the nerves
  they flow along and the magnetic potentials generated between them.
