title: Circling Fragmentations
date: 2021-09-14T13:09:13.937Z
description: Drawing up shapes, lines & details of a material, a memory, in the
  darkroom of inner vision. Trying to hold together the fragments of a being, of
  a body, of a self through a vague shape, with a somnambulant sigh. Through
  varying approaches – found footage (the memories of others) and
  self-portraiture (the dissection of a person) – I try to sculpt layers of
  time, space & material into moments, trapping them into the relentless
  repetition of a gif.

      With soundless footsteps & inaudible breathing, she's evading the grasping
