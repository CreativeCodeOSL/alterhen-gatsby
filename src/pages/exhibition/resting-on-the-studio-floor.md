description: "In this exhibition, Tresset, following his series of Human Study
  #2 installations pursues his exploration of the Vanitas theme;  in contrast to
  the traditional Flemish manner, the atmosphere is stark rather than
  opulent.  Using GIFs as time-based media, these works are experiments in
  minimalist storytelling. "
