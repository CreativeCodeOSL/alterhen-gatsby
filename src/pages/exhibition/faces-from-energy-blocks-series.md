  "How to survive in a metropolis in the midst of urban chaos?
          
          I believe that there are two ways to survive in this environment: Being part of a system created for this purpose or not being part of this system.        
          As an artist, Auni chooses the second option.  Which brings us to another question: How to survive in this environment without surrendering to this system? I think the first step is to have faith.  And she has a lot of it.  Adept of the quantum thought of the materialization of thoughts and the creation of her own reality in a multiverse of possibilities, she goes searching for her treasures in the midst of urban chaos, collecting and gathering them.  Transforming them into objects of power, trophies, symbols that she displays as a surviving warrior in a dystopian world.  Like Augusto de Campos, she transforms garbage into luxury and her fantasy into reality. And it is with this background that she enters the virtual universe.  The metaverses, the internet, the cryptocurrencies, the digital world. In this universe where everything is possible, her faith has no limits.  And within the unlimited, she goes on creating her own universe.  Her path is still young and her exploration is still beginning.  But as a survivor of São Paulo's urban chaos, she is exploring and adapting to this new environment without fear and with a lot of joy. Her objects gain life, gain a function, multiply, and are agglutinated with her own body, which now also becomes a work of art. 
          Where is this going to lead? This is the same question we ask ourselves when we are faced with this new multiverse of possibilities that every day becomes more real among our species.  The digital world. The cryptocurrencies. NFT.

Auni Seiva is a Brazilian artist, born in São Paulo, 1986. She started her trajectory in Graffiti culture, 2005. Not satisfied with just painting her name on walls, she seeks to establish her name as a contemporary artist (without limits). Ethical-existential sustainability Studies of quantum physics, psyche, synchronicity, mysticism (mainly oriental), and the use of discarded objects by the city to criticize the current society, with a tendency to impulsive, irresponsible and often irrational consumerism. The artist realizes that such lack of control is based, countless times, on an attempt to supply internal shortages and emptiness. 

The collection of objects is done mainly in my bicycle trips, that's how I started this research, in the path of 36km (round trip) daily, from Guarulhos, where I lived at the time, to the Alex Vallauri Residence (FUNARTE SP). Currently his work is focused on NFTs, performance and sculptures. She is represented by the gallery "A7MA" with exclusivity of the series "Post-Graffiti"
