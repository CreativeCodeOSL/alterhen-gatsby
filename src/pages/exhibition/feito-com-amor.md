description: Born in 1992, Bernardo holds a degree in Graphic Design from
  PUC-Rio, an urban artist and tattoo artist. He began his research in plastic
  arts in 2018. A descendant of Orientals and a resident of Rio de Janeiro, his
  job consists of searching intersections between these worlds. Intersections
  that time is subtle, time is explicit. There are few moments when we perceive
  them as coexisting in the same space and time. Possible places of collision,
  whether symbols, feelings, or habits - what is established and what is to
  come. The result is works that start from these perceptions of ancestry that
  blend with layers of realities that cross the artist. "Differences become
  affective aesthetic bodies (work), as possible ways of distributing love and
  understanding." - Edmilson Nunes*
