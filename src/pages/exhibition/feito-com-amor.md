description: >-
  "The theme appropriates the speech in the form of hot dishes, and the hardened
  cement is what we harvest, what is served to us and what's left for us, but
  not what we see. False promises and tricked people, soothed by the sarcastic
  phrase “Made with Love”.

  This work was developed during the Formation and Deformation Course, at EAV-Parque Lage. Where we worked during the school term, above questions about transport, food and their crossings."
