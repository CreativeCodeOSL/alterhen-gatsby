title: Two Second Meditations

description: By observing a play on scale, my work encourages looking, and then
  looking slowly and deeply, allowing enough breathing space for meaning to
  materialize. The subjects I use in my paintings range from the familiar
  pictures of ﬂowers, landscapes and portraits, to referenced historical images,
  photos of sports events, to portrayals of imagined, surreal individuals and
  scenarios, these images are purged of their original meaning and is reframed
  as a landscape where tiny beings would be painted over and exist. These minute
  cartoonish characters in humanoid forms are the central unifying theme that
  collates my recent body of works, populating my paintings, sculptures,
  installations, and animations. These beings are depicted in a diverse range of
  human activities and eccentric identities that personiﬁes both mindless and
  intelligent fragments of ideas connecting visible and invisible relationships
  between man and environment, symbols and meaning, space and time, identity and
  the cultural landscape. My work is my reﬂection and response to the world, it
  examines how we humans, through all our advancements and destructions caused,
  are responsible for shaping the bigger image which is this plane we inhabit.
