description: >
  Architecture in Motion is a series of experiments around the notion of hybrid
  space. A questioning of the world we are experiencing here and now.

  The construction of a digital landscape fed by a multitude of data organized and processed by the machine according to a series of simple and repetitive rules. This procedural approach generates spaces and abstract architectures, the start of a new digital exploration.
