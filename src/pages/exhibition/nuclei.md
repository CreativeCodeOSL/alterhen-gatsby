  "Diane Drubay is a visual artist working with photographs and videos to create
  anticipatory visions of other futures. Drawn by the aesthetics of social
  science fiction literature, using colour-psychology and current scientific
  discoveries, the speculative visions depicted by Diane Drubay advocate for
  optimistic images interpreting shocking stories of possible futures.


  Diane Drubay's fascination with natural light and colours started in 2012 while waiting for the golden hour in the garden of Claude Monet at Giverny. There, she captured the awakening of Nature and its changes over the months (she produced or supervised the series of videos 'Monet's Secret Garden').

  Between 2013 and 2018, she has been working on one project tracing the different stages to reach the ultimate transcendence through Nature by compiling hundreds of impressions of the rising and setting sun. This led to a final 23-minute video untitled "Odyssey" and a great number of single videos and photographs. 

  Since 2019, she is exploring natural glitches and how they impact our vision of landscapes and our imagination of the future."

    desc: >-
      Seconds become years. 14 seconds to go from ecstasy to agony. 14 years to
      reach carbon neutrality or the point of no return. This piece plays with
      colour-psychology to create an immersion that draws two possible futures,
      both fascinating and shattering.
