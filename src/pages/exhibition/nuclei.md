  "In her most recent body of work, Diane Drubay imagines secluded landscapes in
  a far future where the Sun can no longer be seen. In this time, Humankind
  constructed artificial planets with solar panels to catch solar energy and
  feed Planet Earth. Only source of natural energy, the artificial planets float
  around in the atmosphere, obstructing our view of the sky and becoming a part
  of our daily lives.

  Deprived of people and calling for the contemplation of a vast and empty landscape, the immersion in this universe is both fascinating and shattering.

  Drawn by the aesthetics of social science fiction literature and current scientific discoveries, the speculative visions depicted by Diane Drubay advocate for optimistic images of the future interpreting shocking stories of possible futures."

      In a near future, artificial planets will populate our sky to capture the
      solar energy that we no longer see.
