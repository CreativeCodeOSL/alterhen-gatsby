  The Y-block was a modernist building by Erling Viksjø, part of the government
  quarter in Oslo. Although only lightly damaged during the terror attack in
  2011, the building was recently demolished, despite a heated public
  controversy.


  I have unfortunately never had the chance to visit the inside of this magnificent synthesis of art and architecture. Thus, I can only imagine—and in my longing create my own interpretations: Inspired by its aesthetics, informed by Viksjø’s philosophy, immortalised on the blockchain.
