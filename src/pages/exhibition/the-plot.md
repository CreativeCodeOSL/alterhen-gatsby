description: "Photogrammetric models of remnants on a clear-cut - a former
  forest that fell victim to climate change - are the departure points for a
  string of works relating to ecological grief. There’s devastating poetry
  connected to these types of photography-based digital models: they resemble
  isolated ruins, simultaneously brand new and in decay. They’re neither here
  nor there, these ghosts that only echo their physical origins in a digital
  void."

      Loop based on a photogrammetric model of three tree stumps at The Plot
      (September 2020, 51° 24‘ 49.8” N - 5° 39‘ 19.9” E). 

      Three tree stumps were left for birds to sit on after a small forest - now called 'The Plot' - was cleared due to a climate change induced fatal spruce bark beetle infestation. The stumps resemble a monument, and are treated as such; they're being 'charged' with emblems and plaquettes related to The Plot's demise.
