<span>a\ter<span>HEN</span></span> aims to imagine new models for the cultural economy by encouraging engagement with NFTs among artists, organisations and art lovers. The first experiment of this initiative is to provide a space to focus on a stunning selection of artworks by a diverse group of artists. This new space also provides a user-friendly, eco-friendly way to purchase the works.

<span>a\ter<span>HEN</span></span> aims to empower artists in a sustainable system that benefits all.
