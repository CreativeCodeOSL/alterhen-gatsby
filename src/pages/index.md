<h1 class="logo-text" style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block">alter<span>HEN</span></h1> aims to imagine new models for the cultural economy by encouraging engagement with NFTâ€™s among artists, organisations and art lovers. The first experiment of this initiative is to provide a space to focus on a stunning selection of artworks by a diverse group of artists. This new space also provides a user-friendly, eco-friendly way to purchase the works.
