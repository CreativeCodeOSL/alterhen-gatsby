<span class="logo-text" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">alterHEN</span></span> aims to encourage engagement with NFT’s among artists, organisations and art lovers and to imagine new models for the cultural economy as a result. The first experiment of this initiative is to provide a space to focus on the art itself, while also providing a gateway to the blockchain itself, to purchase works by a diverse group of artists in an eco-friendly way.

We believe the potential of NFT’s is profound for the cultural economy. It is also here to stay. alterHEN aims to experiment with alternative models for this new world, and to empower artists in a sustainable system that benefits all.

The concept of NFT’s, that of enabling digital artworks to be owned and shared, has created a transformatively new and vibrant space that allows art lovers who may have had no previous connection with the art market to participate.

The borderless, decentralised nature of NFT’s enables artists from a broader range of society and geographical location to be involved, and allows room for exploration of the often overlooked ethical values of diversity, inclusion and environmental awareness. alterHEN also aims to encourage art institutions, curators and collectors to become involved.

The alterHEN space is organised by a group of established and emergent artists who met on the eco-friendly, NFT platform Hic et Nunc. We aim to celebrate the potential of this lively, experimental platform, but also provide a space to allow a more meaningful appreciation of artists and their works,
We also act as a conduit for accessing the works directly on the blockchain itself, along with some helpful advice on how to take part for those with no prior knowledge of the process.
