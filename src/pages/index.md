<span class="logo-text">alterHEN</span>, aims to develop and encourage other cultural and commercial practices to propose something different from the current NFT model. The group comprises international artists from France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the USA, Brazil, Sweden, Danemark, and the Philippines. Members have existing art careers in different fields such as new media, generative art, performance, and photography. Although these artistic practices are exhibited in major cultural institutions and festivals they are mostly neglected in the traditional art market, artists generally having to rely on exhibition fees and grants.

Our aim is to allow cultural organisations and artists to visit exhibitions and navigate between them in an interesting manner. Developing practices and tools that will allow for slower and more thoughtful exhibiting and selling ways inspired by the art world, not only by the gallery system but also by the way art is exhibited in cultural organisations and festivals. The systems we are developing are online galleries that include contextual information, and also discovery and communication tools.

The current and forthcoming economic crisis triggered by the pandemic presents a necessity and an opportunity to experiment and develop new ideas and models. There is a potential to develop a new ecosystem that will not only create new revenue streams for artists and cultural institutions but also new ways to discover and appreciate art.
