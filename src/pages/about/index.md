<span class="logo-text" style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block">a\ter<span>HEN</span></span> aims to encourage engagement with NFT’s among artists, organisations and art lovers and to imagine new models for the cultural economy as a result. The first experiment of this initiative is to provide a space to focus on the art itself, while also providing a gateway to the blockchain, to purchase works by a diverse group of artists in an eco-friendly way.

We believe the potential of NFT’s is profound for the cultural economy. It is also here to stay. alterHEN aims to experiment with alternative models for this new world, and to empower artists in a sustainable system that benefits all.

The concept of NFT’s, that of enabling digital artworks to be owned and shared, has created a transformatively new and vibrant space that allows art lovers who may have had no previous connection with the art market to participate.

The borderless, decentralised nature of NFT’s enables artists from a broader range of society and geographical location to be involved, and allows room for exploration of the often overlooked ethical values of diversity, inclusion and environmental awareness. alterHEN also aims to encourage art institutions, curators and collectors to become involved.

The alterHEN space is organised by a diverse group of established and emergent artists who met on the eco-friendly, NFT platform Hic et Nunc. We aim to celebrate the potential of this lively, experimental platform, but also provide a space to allow a more meaningful appreciation of artists and their works.
We also act as a conduit for accessing the works directly on the blockchain, along with some helpful advice on how to take part for those with no prior knowledge of the process.

## Who are a\terHEN's artists

We are an informal group of International artists from Brazil, Philippines, Norway, Romania, France, Russia, Belgium and Germany who met on hicetnunc. Our practices include a wide range of approaches and media. From abstract to figurative, from performative to interactive, from digital to analog, from sculpting to coding, our work encompasses the whole spectrum of contemporary art practices. Thematically they explore diverse topics** relating to their backgrounds, their surroundings, and their needs & visions for a cultural reality. 
What we share  is our experience of exhibiting, selling and collecting NFTs on the hicetnunc platform. From experience we believe that art should be first and foremost exhibited and experienced as art before being collected, and that not all commercial practices are suited to sell artworks.

## What is hicetnunc?

hicetnunc means “here and now”. hicetnunc (HEN) is a marketplace on the Tezos blockchain founded by Rafael Lima a former social scientist from Brazil. Lima considers the platform as a “social laboratory”.
HEN opened on the first of March 2021, and has seen an amazing growth with now more than 200000 NFT (OBJKTS) listed (minted), hicetnunc is a space without gatekeepers, it is welcoming to anyone who wants to turn their digital artworks  (sound files, images, video, pdf, 3d objects, interactive works) into an OBJKT, the term for NFTs on hicetnunc. To date there are more than 220000 objkts minted, 10000 active daily users 
What differentiates HEN from commercial platforms and has made its success, apart of from its negligible environmental cost and the absence of gatekeepers, is its affordable approach; minimal costs to the artists, 2.5% fee on financial transactions, few cents for listing artworks, low cost editions equivalent to a few euros or dollars, this market characteristic has enabled: access to a large number of artists including from the global south forming a multicultural, multifaceted artistic community. A number generous events such as OBJKTS4OBJKTS, charity collections such as Hiceturco to support Turkish community facing wildfires, or just locality-based communities such as Greek et Nunc for the Greek community, #oBRjkt and HENBR for the Brazilian community.
